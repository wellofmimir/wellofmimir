👋 Hi, I’m @wellofmimir
👀 I’m interested in c++, qt, kotlin and android jetpack compose, programming in general, wrestling, boxing and weightlifting, etfs and stocks, philosophy and history and am very curious in general.
🌱 I’m currently learning app development for android.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything. Just hit me up, if you are interested in collaborating or if you have a request.
